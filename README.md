# Data Structures Tutorial

Welcome to the Data Structures Tutorial.  This tutorial covers three different data structures as follows:

- [Stack](1-stack.md)
- [Set](2-set.md)
- [Tree](3-tree.md)

Each module will contain descriptions and examples. We will also examine the performance of each data structure in terms of **Big O**. At the end of each module, you will find a problem to solve on your own. You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem first. The examples and problems are all in Python language; it is expected that you know how to program in python.
